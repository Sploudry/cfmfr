Over 15 years of professional practice, I have been inspired by the human ability to adapt, be resilient, and heal. My clinical approach focuses on reducing pain and dysfunction, releasing trapped trauma and soft tissue restrictions to promote better health and vitality.

My experience in movement dynamics comes from years of practicing martial arts in Japan, China, and Russia. I am certified in Myofascial Release, Sports Massage & Soft Tissue Therapy, and Therapeutic Massage, as well as Health, Fitness, and Exercise/Mobility Coaching.

As an affiliated tutor with the Massage Training Institute and Federation of Holistic Therapists, I coach with the Sheffield Centre for Massage Training and On The Spot Massage Training UK. I am constantly learning and expanding my knowledge, particularly in functional movement and self-care, through studying with John Barnes and other JBMFR experts in the US and UK.

I look forward to working and learning with you.

Craig Foden
